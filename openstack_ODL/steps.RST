OpenStack with OpenDaylight - workshop steps
============================================

1. Select the VM ``devstack-odl`` in VirtualBox and press the "**Start**" button
   (green right arrow at the top). Wait a minute for the VM to boot.

2. After the VM boots and the login prompt is seen, open a terminal on the laptop,
   and SSH into the VM. Password is ``ciscolive``.

::

      ssh stack@192.168.10.3


3. Deploy OpenStack Ocata with OpenDaylight Boron. It takes about 13 minutes.

::

      cd devstack_odl
      ./stack.sh


4. After ``stack.sh`` ends, the OpenStack Horizon GUI can be accessed in a
   browser at http://192.168.10.3 (username is ``admin``, password is ``password``).

5. In the OpenStack GUI, select the ``demo`` project at the top left (next to the
   OpenStack logo). On the left pane, click on ``Project --> Network --> Network Topology`` and click on the ``Graph`` tab.

6. Close the OpenStack GUI.

7. The OpenDaylight DLUX GUI can be accessed at http://192.168.10.3:8181/index.html (username is ``admin``, password is ``admin``).

8. In the OpenDaylight GUI, click on each of the following on the left pane:

-  Yang Visualizer (select different ``Model`` at the top)
-  Topology
-  Network Virtualization --> 2D View
-  Nodes --> Node connectors --> 2
-  Yang UI

9. Close the OpenDaylight GUI.

10. In the terminal, check if Open vSwitch (virtual layer-2 switch) is listening on TCP ports ``6640`` and ``6653``.

::

      sudo ovs-vsctl show
      sudo ovs-vsctl show | grep '6640\|6653'


11. Check if the ``opendaylight`` process is running.

::

      ps aux | grep opendaylight


12. Check the OVS configuration and interface mapping.

::

      sudo ovs-vsctl get Open_vSwitch . other_config


13. Check if OpenDaylight is the service plugin in neutron's configuration file ``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf``.

::

      grep -i odl /etc/neutron/neutron.conf


14. Check if neutron's ml2 configuration file ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini`` has OpenDaylight settings.

::

      grep -i 'opend\|odl\|8087' /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini 


15. Check if neutron-server is using the right configuration files that have the OpenDaylight settings.

::

      ps aux | grep ml2


16. Check if all the neutron agents are running correctly.

::

      source accrc/admin/admin
      neutron agent-list


17. Check if the following ml2 OpenDaylight endpoints can accessed in a browser (username is ``admin``, password is ``admin``).

-  http://192.168.10.3:8087/restconf/config/neutron:neutron?prettyPrint=true

-  http://192.168.10.3:8087/restconf/operational/network-topology:network-topology

-  http://192.168.10.3:8087/controller/nb/v2/neutron/routers

18. Enter the OpenDaylight Karaf client shell.

::

      /opt/stack/opendaylight/distribution-karaf-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/client 


19. In the OpenDaylight Karaf client shell, check if the OpenStack neutron features are installed.

::

      feature:list -i | grep -i neutron


20. Check if the Open vSwitch features are installed.

::

      feature:list -i | grep -i ovs


21. Check if the netvirt OpenStack features in installed.

::

      feature:list -i | grep -i openstack


22. Check ODL OpenFlow statistics and session statistics.

::

      ofp:showstats


23. Check the ODL web end points.

::

      web:list


24. Check if the ODL configurations have the right settings needed for OpenStack neutron.

::

      config:list  | grep -i neutron
      config:list  | grep -i openstack


25. Hit ``CTRL+d`` and exit the OpenDaylight Karaf client shell.

26. Check the OpenFlow 1.3 table in the OVS bridge ``br-int``.

::

      sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows br-int
